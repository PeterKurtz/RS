You can add inline text as follows, e.g., to
provide the result of an R calculation in a sentence:
The mean temperature is `r mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)` degrees Fahrenheit.

By the way, did you know that `r mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)` degrees Fahrenheit are
`r tempC(mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE))` degrees Celsius?

This looks terrible! So let's round this to two digits after the decimal point:
Did you know that about `r round(mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2)` degrees Fahrenheit are
about `r round(tempC(mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)), digits = 2)` degrees Celsius?
