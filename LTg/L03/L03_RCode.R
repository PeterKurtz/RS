11 %% 7    


# p7

# For better readability, we add spaces before & after most operators (with a few exceptions)

# Possible, but avoid:
x <- rnorm(100); hist(x)

# First think what R will do with the following; then execute them in R:




# p15

x <- 10^(15 / 3 - 2)

sqrt(x)

x


# p16

# What does the following do? First think, then execute this in R:

x < - 10^(15 / 3 - 2)
