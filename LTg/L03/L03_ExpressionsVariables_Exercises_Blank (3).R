#For the following exercises, you may reference the information at:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density

# 1.) Suppose x is a random variable distributed uniformly between 0 & 10.
# Note: you don't need any variables for this part. 
# a. Write an expression to calculate the mean of x. 


# b. Write an expression to calculate the variance of x.


# c. Write an expression to calculate the probability that x is less
# than 3.

# 2.) Repeat problem 1, this time using the following variables
a <- 0
b <- 10
xi <- 3 # This is the sample x-value for C.
# a. Write an expression to calculate the mean of xi. 


# b. Write an expression to calculate the variance of xi.


# c. Write an expression to calculate the probability that xi is less
# than 3. 


# 3.) For this problem, we will build expressions without using variables.
# If you don't know what equation to use for a particular problem use google.
# Feel free to copy code from previous solutions where it is helpful.
#a. Calculate the area of a circle with radius .2m


# b. Calculate the volume of a cylinder with height 0.5m, and the above 
# circle as its base.


# c. If the cylinder is made of concrete (density=2400 kg/(m^3)),
# calculate its weight. 


# d. Assuming a truck has a weight capacity of 36287kg, how many concrete 
# cylinders can 1 truck carry?


# NOTE: Your answer to D should be 240 cylinders, if you got something else,
# check back through your code to see if you made any mistakes. 


# 4.) For this problem, we will be repeat problem 1 using variables.
#a. Calculate the area of a circle with radius .2m
r<-0.2

# b. Calculate the volume of a cylinder with height 0.5m, and the above 
# circle as its base.
h<-0.5


# c. If the cylinder is made of concrete (density=2400 kg/(m^3)),
# calculate its weight. 
rho<-2400


# d. Assuming a truck has a weight capacity of 36287kg, how many concrete 
# cylinders can 1 truck carry?
W_allow<-36287


# 5.) Briefly comment on how the use of variables affected your ability to 
# solve the previous problems? Why might a solution that uses variables be 
# better or worse than a solution where all values are hard-coded?
